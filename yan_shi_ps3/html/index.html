<h3>TODO</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Convolve using a separable gaussian filter. Right now, the program runs for quite
	a bit of processing time. Separable filters would fix that.</li>
	<li>Include an applet of some kind on the website! This would require some JavaScrip or a way to
render python scripts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of the project was to create and implement my_imfilter.py which involved coding our
own cross correlation function, convolution2d function, a gaussian kernel function, a low pass (blur) function, and a high pass (sharpen) function.
We would then use these functions to create a hybrid image, an image that contains the low-pass frequencies
of one image and the high-pass frequences of another image. This image is an optical illusion: we are able
to see the high pass image from up close but unable to see the low pass image until we are far away enough in distance.
This refers to the types of frequencies that we are able to see in certain distances. Lower frequencies can be seen at a farther distance
and higher frequencies can be seen up front.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of the setup was the correlation function and the gaussian kernel function. The convolution
function required the correlation function, and the gaussian kernel function was required throughout the written program. Let's start talking
about the function.</p>

<div style="clear:both">
<h2>Functions and Algorithms</h2>
<p>The functions were given to us and algorithms were based off of the readings in Richard Szeliski's book and in the
research article <a href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/publications/OlivaTorralb_Hybrid_Siggraph06.pdf">Hybrid Images (Olivia, Torralba, and Schyns)</a>.
We focus primarily on the standard deviation of the gaussian filter, &sigma; and alpha for the high-pass function in order to determine
the best way render the hybridized image. The hybrid image is the <strong>sum</strong> of the high-pass frequencies of one image and the <strong>low-pass</strong>
frequencies of another image. There was a <strong>cut-off frequency</strong> that we had to keep in mind in order to properly
hybridize the two images together. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Because of the nature of convolution and the current implementation that I have, the
runtime for the program itself can reach up to a minute given the size of the images. So please be patient if you are running the program at all.
There are print statments dictating where calculations are happening in the program to ensure that things are working peachy!</p>
<h2>Cross Correlation &amp; Convolution</h2>
<p>
<code>cross_correlate_2d(image, kernel)</code> takes the argument of image and kernel. We pad the image using <code>np.pad</code> and then
we loop through the image from the rows and columns. We determine the window of interest here of the padded image that we would like to
run the correlations for. We initialize an empty list to take in numbers for the total calculation of the window elements times the kernel elements.
We then sum the list that we created and put that in the output[i,j] and return the output.</p>
<p>
	<code>convolve2d(image, kernel, color)</code> required the above function in order to properly work. There we also determined whether or not the
	image was to be convolved with three channels, i.e. it is a color image, or just grayscale (two channels, 2D matrix). Here we had to flip the kernel
	to do convolution—this means that the kernel argument in <code>cross_correlate_2d</code> when passed in is kernel that has been flipped in the x and y
	direction. If the image is a colored image, then we will split the image's channels and convolve each channel individually before returning the image.
	Otherwise, it will continue--much of this information can also be found reading the working file.
</p>
<h2>Kernel</h2>
<p>
	<code>gaussian_blur_kernel_2d(kernel_size, sigma)</code> is needed by all the other functions and was one of the trickier ones to figure out. Here
	we determine the appropriateness of the <code>kernel_size</code>. I disagreed with allowing arbitrary kernel sizes, as most kernels we'll encounter
	are usually symmetric in nature. Therefore, our kernels here only reflect a symmetric matrix—which suits our needs perfectly fine. I determined
	the gaussian kernel to be the following equation:
	<br/>
	<pre><code>gmask = np.exp(-((x**2/float(kernel_size) + y**2/float(kernel_size))/(2*sigma**2))</code></pre>
	<br/>
	We then also take the <code>gmask</code> and find the average. This function will not allow even kernel sizes as it is difficult to find the center
	of even kernel sizes. Odd kernel sizes guarantee an easy center find. We can also control sigma here as well, which dictates the strength of
	blurring.
</p>
<h2>High Pass and Low Pass</h2>
<p>
	<code>low_pass(image)</code> and 	<code>high_pass(image)</code> requires the <code>convolve2d()</code> function. The former function
	requires only the gaussian_blur_kernel_2d() to be convolved properly. The latter function required two copies of the original image
	in order to be properly manipulated. In order to get a high passed image, we subtract the blurred image from the original image, leaving
	us with just the sharp bits! We can amplify this sharp bits with <i>alpha</i>.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>For the first discussion of the results, I will display both the gray scale and color versions of the hybrid images to show
	that the program can do both. Other images afterwards will be in COLOR. </p>

<p>The high-pass image here was the cat and the low pass iamge was the dog.
Some notable things: alpha=1 for the <code>high_pass</code> filter and sigma=5 for the <code>low_pass</code> filter. I kept the blurring for
the high pass to be the same as the low_pass. If I went any higher than 5, I would often start to see
more artificats and corruption of the image itself—or one image would dominate the other if it was TOO sharp or TOO blurry.
This was the <strong>frequency cutoff</strong> that was discussed in class. </p>
<p>I also tried this the other way around, i.e. the high-pass image was now the dog and the low-pass image
was now the cat.</p>
<table>

			</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>... This doesn't work as well, and it's likely because the cat is such a bright color that it
overpowers the dog that's more neutral and natural in its tones. There are very little blending effects. </p>

<p>Not quite perfect, but it is definitely a successful hybridization of images. The blurred
effect of Marilyn Monroe had to be downgraded, as well as the sharpness of Albert Einstein as both
of the original images have very intense values. Being cognizant of these values, I made sure to fiddle
around the settings to create a satisfactory image. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Fish &amp; Submarine</h3>
<h4>Original</h4>
<table>
	<tr>

<img src="images/gifs/fish_sub.gif" width="24%"/>
</table>
<p>What this specifically taught me was that the colors of images definitely do matter. Take a look at the
reverse below.</p>
<table>
<img src="images/low/low_pass_fish_v2_color.png" width="24%"/>
<img src="images/high/high_pass_sub_v2_color.png"  width="24%"/>
<img src="images/hybrids/hybrid_sub_fish_v2_color.png" width="24%"/>
</table>
<p>See how this doesn't work as well? It's likely because the color of the fish is much brighter than the blue of the
submarine. Hence, doing it the other way around makes for the most convincing illusion.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Motorcycle &amp; Bicycle</h3>
<h4>Original</h4>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<img src="images/original/motorcycle.bmp" width="35%"/>
			<img src="images/original/bicycle.bmp" width="35%"/>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h4>Hybrid</h4>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="images/low/low_pass_motorcycle_v2_color.png" width="35%"/>
		<img src="images/high/high_pass_bike_v2_color.png"  width="35%"/>
		<img src="images/hybrids/hybrid_bike_motorcycle_v2_color.png" width="35%"/>
		<img src="images/gifs/bike_motor.gif" width="35%"/>
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>As discussed in the paper, because of the brightness of the biccle and the nature of the motorcycle, it is often helpful to
make one grayscale and act as a shadow than to have two colored images overlayed on top of each other. I couldn't figure out
how to convolve only two channels of the bicycle's high_pass, so I turned it into a grayscael image overall. This still looks
pretty convincing, though I would've liked to have kept the color.</p>

<p>This goes to show that you shouldn't use pictures that involve in the slighest bit of movement. Also,
	I recommend pulling these images into a new tab or saving them to zoom in and out on your own!</p>

<div style="clear:both">
	<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
	<p>This was, overall, a successful and fun project. However, with more time, I can definitely finess the project and the code
		to be more efficient with its calculations. I took a bit of leeway with some of the criteria, but I feel as if I have justified my stance.
		Nonetheless, the results and experimentation that I discovered along the way gives me insight for a better iteration of this project in
		the near future as a possible web application—this coulde be fun!</p>
	<p>Overall, it appeared to be that the frequency cut off for most things was from about 5-7,8. Anything higher would cause the
		images to look out of sync and unnatural. There could not be <strong>too</strong> much sharpening or blurring or else one would
		dominate the other. The striking of balance was necessary and that meant fiddling around with the sigma and the alpha to determine
		what worked best. If I had to do this again, I think I would rather work in the Fourier space than the spatial space, as the spatial
		space doesn't allow for that dramatic of a change in terms of sharpening—as that was my biggest issue. Nonetheless, overall, I had a great
	if not stressful time with this assignment.</p>
	<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
