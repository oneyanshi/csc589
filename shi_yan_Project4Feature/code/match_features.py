# % Local Feature Stencil Code
# CSC 589 Intro to computer vision. 
# Code adapated from MATLAB written by James Hayes from Brown University.

# % 'features1' and 'features2' are the n x feature dimensionality features
# %   from the two images.
# % If you want to include geometric verification in this stage, you can add
# % the x and y locations of the features as additional inputs.
# %
# % 'matches' is a k x 2 matrix, where k is the number of matches. The first
# %   column is an index in features 1, the second column is an index
# %   in features2. 
# % 'Confidences' is a k x 1 matrix with a real valued confidence for every
# %   match.
# % 'matches' and 'confidences' can empty, e.g. 0x2 and 0x1.
