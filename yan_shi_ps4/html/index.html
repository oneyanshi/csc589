<h2>CSC 589 AU / Homework 4 / Image Blending Using Pyramids</h2>

<p>  For Homework 4, I was tasked to display and create the Laplacian and 
gaussian pyramids. What are these pyramids, and why should we even care 
about them? Simply put, people are able to properly understand certain parts 
of an image. Pixels are great for spatial resolution, but it tells us very little information 
about the frequency. However, Fourier transforms, on the other hand, are great for 
frequency access but not for spatial info. Pyramids are the balance between frequency 
and spatial information. </p>

<p>We find these pyramids by subsampling the image by a rate of 2, a generally accepted 
and used rate, up or down. However, before we do this, we would blur the image and then subsample, to avoid 
aliasing. This tosses away a lot of the high frequencies that the images would keep as we subsample.
Please see the image to the right to get a better idea of how it works. 
</p>
<p>But why is this interesting in the first place? Well, that's a fair question! Using these pyramids and
with a particular formula related to the Laplacian pyramids of two images and the gaussian pyramid of a given mask, 
we can create more realistic and more interesting ways of blending images together. Hence, we have arrived at the idea of 
masking. Take a look at the images at the bottom. </p>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/apple.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/orange.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/amateur_blend.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>This is a very amateur way of blending two images together: taking the half of one image and the half of another 
and putting them together. As you can see, it's easy to fall out of the illusion that this is a strange hybrid of an 
apple and an orange when you can clearly see the line in the middle. The method that will be discussed will resolve this. 
To see the code related to this project, direct yourself to the <a href="">Github repository</a>.
</p>
<p>To begin, let's talk about the functions and the algorithms associated with the functions.</p>

<h2>Interpolation</h2>
<p>Interpolation, as it is explained in the code, enlarges the image with an upsampling rate of r = 2. 
The image's width and length are doubled, which means that the area is quadrupled. This will primarily be used 
in the creation of the Laplacian pyramids, which rely on gaussian pyramids. This is further explained in the section 
below that discusses the construction of pyramids in depth. 
</p>
<pre><code>
	def interpolate(image):
		"""
		interpolates an image with upsampling rate, r = 2 
		"""
		image_up = np.zeros((2*image.shape[0], 2*image.shape[1]))
		# upsample 
		image_up[::2, ::2] = image[:,:]
		# blur (we need to scale this up since kernel has unit area)
		# the length and width are doubled, so the area is quadrupled 
	
		return (4 * (ndimage.filters.convolve(image_up, kernel, mode='constant')))</code></pre>

<h2>Decimation</h2>
<p>As it is explained in the <code>decimate</code> function, decimation reduces the 
image by a downsampling rate of 2. This will primarily be used by the function that creates 
the gaussian pyramid.</p>
<pre><code>
	def decimate(image): 
		""" 
		decimates an image with downsampling rate, r = 2
		""" 
		# downsample 
		image_blur = ndimage.filters.convolve(image, kernel, mode='constant')
	
		return image_blur[::2, ::2]
	
	</code></pre>

<h2>Construction of Pyramids</h2>
<p>In order to construct pyramids, we need a filter--for this homework assignment, we are using 
the filter that was provided by Professor Xiao, a binomial 5-tap filter. Refer to the code for more 
information.</p>
<p>
To build the gaussian pyramid, we blur and then subsample the image before decimating the image by about 1/2. 
As stated previously, the Laplacian pyramid is reliant on the gaussian pyramids. In order to find the levels of 
the Laplacian pyramid, we find the difference that is formed between that specific level in the gaussian pyramid 
and expanded version of its upper level in that pyramid. This refers this line in the code: 
<pre><code>LaplacianPyramid.append(GaussianPyramid[i] - interpolate(GaussianPyramid[i + 1]))</code></pre>
</p>
<p>The full function appears like this, which finds both the Laplacian and gaussian pyramids and returns 
the results: </p>
<pre><code>
	def pyramids(image): 
		""" 
		constructs Gaussian and Laplacian pyrmaids 
		parameters: 
			image: the original image (the base of the pyrmaid)
		returns: 
			GaussianPyramid: the gaussian pyrmaid 
			LaplacianPyramid: the Laplacian pyrmaid 
		""" 
		GaussianPyramid = [image, ]
		LaplacianPyramid = []

		# build the gaussian pyrmaid 
		while image.shape[0] >= 2 and image.shape[1] >= 2: 
			image = decimate(image)
			GaussianPyramid.append(image)
		
		# build the Laplacian pyramid
		for i in range(len(GaussianPyramid)-1): 
			# Laplacian pyramids are found using the lvl of one gaussian level and 
			# the level of the next one 
			LaplacianPyramid.append(GaussianPyramid[i] - interpolate(GaussianPyramid[i + 1]))

		return GaussianPyramid[:-1], LaplacianPyramid</code></pre>
<h2>The Pyramids</h2>
<p>In this section, we will now discuss the pyramids themselves. In the discussion of the gaussian and Laplacian 
	pyramids, it is easier to see the effects of these items in grayscale rather than in color, as it is easier to 
	note the details in each. I've increased the brightness of the Laplacian pyramids in order to better see the details 
	by about 30% for the apple image and 60% for the orange image.

<h2>Blending</h2>
<p>The following is the blending function. Using the equation that is stated below, we are able to successfully 
blend the two images in question. </p>
<pre><code>
	def blending(laplacian_pyramid_1, laplacian_pyramid_2, gauss_pyramid_mask):
		""" 
		LS(i,j) = GR(I,j,)*LA(I,j) + (1-GR(I,j))*LB(I,j)
		"""
		blend_pyramid = []
		for i in range(0, len(laplacian_pyramid_1)):
			# first half of the equation 
			first_half = (gauss_pyramid_mask[i] * laplacian_pyramid_1[i])
	
			# second half of the equation 
			second_half = ((1-gauss_pyramid_mask[i]) * (laplacian_pyramid_2[i]))
	
			# append the first + second to blend_pyrmaid 
			blend_pyramid.append(first_half + second_half)
	
		return blend_pyramid</code></pre>
	<p></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<h4>Apples &amp; Oranges</h4>
<p>Let's take a look at the apple and the orange image again. Using this method to blend images, we have the 
following result: </p>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/apple.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/orange.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/mask.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_appleorange_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>This worked out pretty well! You can no longer see / tell where the apple begins and where the orange meets. 
	Because the environment that these images existed in were the same, the blended image is very believable. The 
	mask, obviously, supresses one and takes the 'white' side as what will be masked on the apple image. 
</p>
<h4>Sunflowers &amp; Godfrey Gao</h4>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/gao.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/sun_flower3.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/gao_mask.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_gaoflower_part2_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>
Despite some of the shortcomings with this image, I do believe that this is a success. This, as I discuss in 
the failure section (as I had an iteration before this), required a lot of finessing to work properly. The 
end result is sweet and cute and showcases my admiration for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Gao">actor Godfrey Gao</a>.
The image at the end of this page shows a cropped version of this blended image. The basis for my mask was 
Godfrey Gao. 
</p>
<h4>Pandas &amp; Eagles</h4>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/panda.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/eagle.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/panda_mask.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_eaglepanda_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>
This worked surprisingly well! I didn't think it would work the way that it did, but the panda's fluffiness
and the eagle's featheriness worked to create an interesting illusion. It runs a bit in the uncanny valley, 
where you can't quite tell <em>what</em> is so different about the panda. I used the panda as the basis for 
my mask in this case. 
</p>
<h4>Hands &amp; Eyes &amp; Tongues?</h4>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/hands.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/einstein_tongue.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/einstein_tongue_mask.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_hand_eyes_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/hands.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/einstein_tongue_original.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/einstein_tongue_face_mask.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_hand_eyes_face_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>To be frank, I have a hard time looking at these without feeling unnerved. However, I wanted to 
try my hand at a bit of horror and consider both of these iterations successes. I had to crop Einstein's photo
a bit to allow for the eyes to be on a lower level to rest somewhat on the inside of the hand. I decided to 
grayscale the hand image as the Einstein image was on a grayscale level already.
</p>
<p>The tongue and mustache was largely for fun and to see what it would look like, but isn't it a bit neat looking?</p>
<h3>Failures</h3>
<h4>Oops, missed.</h4>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/gao.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/sunflower.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/gao_mask_1.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_gaoflower_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>Above, there is a successful blending of these two images. However, this was only the case after I had 
		moved the sunflower just enough to allow for Godfrey Gao's head to sit in the middle of the flower. There 
		was a lot of need to readjust in my image editor in order for the mask to properly work. 

</p>
<h4>A bad match.</h4>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/cat.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/dog.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/dogcatmask.png" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_dogcat_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>This blend of a dog and cat was a failure--with an adjustment of the mask, perhaps it could have been better.
		Regardless, the features don't line up really well and the grass is a bit offputting. 
		</p>
<h4>Fly... Panda?</h4>
<table>
		<tr>
		<td>
		<img src="../data/panda.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/eagle.jpg"  width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/eagle_mask.jpg" width="24%"/>
		<img src="../data/output/blend_pandaeagle_image.png" width="24%"/>
		</td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p>This blend is much like the first one, where the match was not very good nor believable.

		<h2>Thoughts &amp; Conclusions</h2>
	<div style="float: left; padding: 5px">
			<img src="../data/output/blend_gaoflower_part2_image_crop_cute.png" width="75%">
		</div>
<p>There is <strong>one</strong> thing that I would change, and that is making sure that the input images 
could be of different dimensions that are not strictly 512 px by 512 px. Figuring out that the algorithm that 
I have implemented didn't allow for different depths. Otherwise, this was a fun project! The algorithms that were
discussed in class were straightforward and fairly easy to implement, and the steps to do each part of the project 
were pretty clear. </p>
<p>Other things to note, I believe this algorithm begins to fail for images that require opacity/transparency 
	of some kind to fully work. It requires a bit of finessing with the mask to properly execute the blend. This 
	algorithm fails in the area of precision or when values are too intense / not quite the same. Images need to 
	be the same size in order for this algorithm to work -- this includes the mask, too.
